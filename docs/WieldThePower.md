# Wield The Power

In the mythical realm of Large Language Models, not just any mortal can harness their full potential. It requires ancient knowledge, powerful resources, and sacred tools to control these formidable AI beings. Here, we shall explore the legendary ways to summon LLMs, the mystical artifacts and resources required, and the arcane art of Inference.

## Summoning the LLMs

There are several ancient rituals to summon LLMs, each requiring different offerings and incantations.

1. **The Rite of Local Deployment**: This ancient ritual involves invoking the model on your sacred altar. It requires the power of a celestial GPU and the essence of mighty amounts of VRAM. Fear not, with proper cleansing, peasants without the celestial requirements can invoke them on their modest CPUs and their RAM.

2. **The Ceremony of Cloud Deployment**: This ritual involves summoning the model on a divine platform in the celestial realm. It offers the blessing of scalability and eliminates the need for local offerings...

3. **The Incantation of API Access**: Some LLMs can be summoned via arcane symbols named APIs. This is a mystical way to invoke the model without the need for deployment or resources by pledging your soul to a master.

## The Arcane Art of Inference

### The Mystical Resources for Local Deployment

Summoning LLMs requires powerful resources, bestowed by the gods. Inference requires expensive sacrifices...

1. **The Power of the Celestial Body, the GPU**: LLMs require the power of a celestial body to process vast amounts of data and perform complex calculations.

2. **The Essence of the Mighty Spirit, VRAM**: LLMs also" require the essence of a mighty spirit to store and process data.

3. **The Gift of the Earth, Storage**: LLMs need the gift of the earth to store the model parameters and any data used for training or inference.

However, expertise has created special formats for special cases, allowing for Inference Optimized for the sake of their master... These are...
- **GGUF**: Taking into his heart the people, a format made from the debris of an ancient relic... GGML... for the peasants with a poor Celestial Body, this format was specially crafted for CPU & GPU offloading... allowing them to sacrifice their CPUs & RAM instead.
- **EXL2**: Fast Inference, this was something desired by the most ambitious, and something he, none other than Turboderp, made possible... with the creation of the legendary EXLLAMA later preceded by EXLLAMAV2, he made fast inference possible for anyone with a pure enough spirit.
- **AWQ**: Speed isn't enough; the desire to solve many problems at once, a technique called Batching, made this a desired format by many seeking world domination.
- **GPTQ**: Ugh...

There are other options in the world of quantization, nevertheless... some of these include:
- **SmoothQuant**: Quick and smooth quant, for those seeking balance in your seek for wisdom.
- **BnB**: A choice born from despair or lazyness, for when all other options have been exhausted.

### The Abacus
